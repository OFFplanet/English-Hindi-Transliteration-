# English-Hindi-Transliteration

Instructions to run the code:
 - Run all the cells in the Devnagri_Assignment.ipynb
 - Train the model for preferably 50 epochs (although you may increase the number of epochs for better accuracy)
 - Use Transliterate() function and pass an english word as arguement to get the transliterated hindi word.

I got a loss of 0.39 and a BLEU score of 0.6785104875680766.


A Few Examples:
 - khaana -> खाना
 - bhookh -> भूख
 - bhai -> भाई
